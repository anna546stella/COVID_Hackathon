# Bulk RNA expression from lung cell-line viral infection

This dataset covers multiple related experiments, all involving human cell lines. All experiments
are done in vitro, and measured by bulk RNA-sequencing. Experiments are done in 2 to 4 replictes.
Like the other RNA datasets, the data matrices provided are already properly normalized as opposed
to being raw counts.

Experiment "Series 1" involves NHBE bronchial epithelial cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 measured 
after 24 hours post-infection or mock treatment.

Experiment "Series 2" involves a similar infection experiment on A549 lung cancer cell lines.

Experiment "Series 3" involves a similar experiment to 2 but infecting the A549 cells with respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) instead of SARS-CoV-2

Experiment "Series 4" involves a similar experiment to 2 and 3 but infecting the A549 cells with
influenza virus (IAV) instead

Experiment "Series 5" is the same as 2 except with a ten times higher dose of SARS-CoV-2 virus

Experiment "Series 6" is infecting the A549 cells after they had been engineered to overexpress
the ACE2 receptor the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter cells

Experiment "Series 7" is infecting Calu lung cancer cell lines which naturally express high levels
of ACE2 receptor

Experiment "Series 8" infects A549 cells with RSV and parainﬂuenza (HPIV3) viruses

Experiment "Series 9" involves triggering antiviral responses in NHBE cells, including influenza infection 
(IAV), infection with engineered influenza which lacks its normal ability to block antiviral responses (IAVdNS1),
and a timecourse of treatment with interferon beta (IFNB) which induces the antiviral responses

Experiment "Series 16" repeats the same conditions as 6, except it also adds an additional condition
of the A549 cells overexpressing ACE2 that have been treated with the drug ruxolitinib (Rux) which
prevents antiviral response signaling
  
Note that there is also a row in the gene list called "SARS2", which counts the number of total viral RNA
molecules detected in the sample.
