# Bulk RNA expression from infected ferrets

This dataset includes related experiments on a ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Note that although
the virus has no difficulty infecting ferrets, unlike humans ferrets avoid major illness or death.

Experiments "Series 10", "11", "12", and "13" are a timecourse measuring nasal cells. Samples
were taken at 1, 3, 7, or 14 days post-infection. There is a mock-treated ferret control group, 
SARS-CoV-2 infected group, and at day 7 there is a measurement of an influenza (IAV) infected 
comparison group.

Experiment "Series 14" are trachea samples taken from the lungs of ferrets that had been infected
for 3 days either with SARS-CoV-2, or influenza (IAV), or an uninfected control.

There are two additional columns that map these ferret gene IDs to their nearest human orthologs,
so you can more easily compare the ferret results to the human datasets.
