### What interesting questions still need to be answered?


## Expression data

- What are the cell types that the virus is able to infect? 
	- Which cells express the known ACE2 receptor?
	- Where are the enzymes such as TMPRSS2 that are needed for viral entry found?
	- For putative new receptors or entry factors, where are they found in the body?

- How does the virus interact with the body's natural interferon antivral response?
	- Are interferon-regulated genes differentially expressed in infected cells?
	- How does interferon expression compare between SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections?
	
- Does it look like viral infection is triggering programmed cell death (apoptosis)?
	- Is there upregulation of genes known to be linked to apoptosis such as CASP3?
	- In the single-cell data, do cells from infected patients appear less healthy?
	

## Animal model data

- How reliably similar to humans does the animal model seem to behave?
	- What is the overlap between the differentially-expressed genes in infected human lung and ferret lung?
	- Do there seem to be more detection of immune cells (based on counts of immune-restricted genes like CD4, etc) in either the ferret or human?



## Mutation data

- What potential mutations appear to have the greatest risk of changing how the spike binds?
	- Which specific mutations led to the greatest increase of binding? What about greatest loss?
	- Which positions in the spike protein are generally most sensitive to any kind of mutation?
